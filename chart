 [ERROR] TS2345: Argument of type '(response: any[]) => void' is not assignable to parameter of type '(value: Object) => void'.
  Types of parameters 'response' and 'value' are incompatible.
    The 'Object' type is assignable to very few other types. Did you mean to use the 'any' type instead?
      Type 'Object' is missing the following properties from type 'any[]': length, pop, push, concat, and 35 more. [plugin angular-compiler]
