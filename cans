  Error occurs in the template of component DashboardComponent.

X [ERROR] Could not resolve "@angular/cdk/portal"

    node_modules/@swimlane/ngx-charts/fesm2020/swimlane-ngx-charts.mjs:6:49:

  You can mark the path "@angular/cdk/portal" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this error and leave the unresolved path in the bundle.
